    <p>Here are Duck INC we LOVE Ducks! That's right, we are the first and one real advocate for duck kind and goose kind alike.
        "Goose?" You may be asking? Well yes! That's right, here at Duck INC. We don't simply love ducks but all water-resistant floating feather tails alike!
        "What are we doing for Duck kind?" I'm so glad you asked! Duck INC is determined to make the world a better place for duck and geese kind by cleaning up local
        ponds through company fundraiser events and finding homes for ducks abandoned by their owners with no hope of life alone in the wild. If you are interested in helping
        us help these beautiful duck and geese alike, then please reach out to us at (xxx)xxx-xxxx. Thank you, and we hope you enjoy your stay on Duck INC's website and enjoy the adorable
        pictures of our ducks that are looking for fosters and forever homes <3.
